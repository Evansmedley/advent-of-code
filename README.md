# advent-of-code

Working on this as a way to practise my test driven development skill, and as a way to continue to improve the quality and readability of the code that I write!

My plan is to do the first several days in Python, a language I know very well, and then progress to using C++ (with which I am currently refamiliarizing myself) and Go (which I am not very familiar with at all).
