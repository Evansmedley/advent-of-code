# advent-of-code

Working on this to practise my test driven development, continue to improve the quality and readability of the code that I write!

My plan is to do the first several days in Python (a language I know very well), the next few with C++ (with which I am currently refamiliarizing myself), and then finish it off with Go (which I am not very familiar with at all).
